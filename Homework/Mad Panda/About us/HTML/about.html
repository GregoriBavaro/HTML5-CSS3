        <p>Mad Panda was founded in 2001 by Greg. The company's original name was Soft Trading, and it was changed to SteelSeries in 2007. Soft Trading made the Icemat and Mad Panda Pad mouse mats, which influenced the company's eventual name change. In 2008, Mad Panda acquired Ideazon, a North America-based developer and manufacturer of gaming peripherals.

            Greg, the company's first CEO, helped the company establish its brand and grow to a global footprint. In 2007, Mad Panda hired Bruce Hawver as CEO. The company saw tremendous growth over the next five years as it expanded its portfolio and channels, developed the SteelSeries Engine platform, and added partnerships across the esports and the gaming ecosystem.
            
            In 2012, Mad Panda received investments of undisclosed amounts from U.S.-based private equity firm Catterton Partners and China-based private equity firm ClearVue Partners.
            
            Their popular products include their Rival and Sensei series of mice, Arctis headsets, and Apex keyboards. They also have made 5XL mousepads (QcK line). Mad Panda often creates limited edition collaborations, such as the Valve CS:GO Howl Edition mouse and mousepad, and the CD Project Cyberpunk 2077 headset.
            
            In July 2019, Mad Panda was acquired by Axcel, a Nordic private equity firm.
            
            In April 2020, Mad Panda acquired Nahimic audio software developer A-Volute, and in December 2020, SteelSeries acquired gaming accessory manufacturer KontrolFreek.
            
            In October 2021, GN Store Nord announced plans to acquire SteelSeries from Axcel for 8 billion DKK (about US$1.25 billion).</p>
